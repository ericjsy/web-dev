					<h3>Our History</h3>
					<p class="philosophy"> 
						In 2007, Ryan and Eric unveiled Madeleine's by opening its doors to the Vancouver market at 1234 Bakery Lane. Ryan is a third generation baker, and his grandfather operated a bakery in Vancouver since 1925.
					</p><br>
					<p class="philosophy">Eric worked as a technical consultant for a bakery ingredient company before opening Madeleine's Bakery.
